- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dragon-Stars-Spades
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (Culinary, Java, Ruby, office management)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (nothing yet).
- 📫 How to reach me (until I get to a better level, you don't need to reach me on anything.)

To be honest here, I opened this account, not in hope of doing anything besides to get to know more about project making and learning the computer languages.
So if you know the good and best direction when it comes to learning new coding languages effectively, please contact me or leave a comment below.

 Thank you for reading.
